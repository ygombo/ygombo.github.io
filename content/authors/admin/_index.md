    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi there! I am Yoshua, a robotics enthusiast and an engineer by training. I received the Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering with focus on robotics and controls from the University of Washington-Seattle, under the advisory of Professor Santosh Devasia in the Precison Controls Laboratory. My research interests are in the areas of control of multi robot teams and robotics for manufacturing. 
Currently, I'm building Konstruksi.AI, a construction-focused technology startup that enables real-time project monitoring using AI-based solutions. 
My dream is to see human and robot working together.
