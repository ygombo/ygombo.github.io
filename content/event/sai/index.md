summary: "I shared about how we can use technology, especially robotics and AI to improve food production (enabling precision agriculture)."
abstract: "In this session, I shared insights on how technology—particularly robotics and artificial intelligence—can significantly enhance food production through precision agriculture. By integrating intelligent sensing, automation, and data-driven decision-making, we can optimize resource use, reduce waste, and increase yields. This approach not only modernizes agricultural practices but also opens pathways for scalable, sustainable solutions that empower farmers and strengthen our food systems for the future."
