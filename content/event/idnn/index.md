summary: "This workshop focuses on the development of the computational intelligence in the area of robotic networks."
abstract: "This workshop explores the crucial role of computational intelligence (CI) in the development of multi-agent systems (MAS) and robotic networks. We'll delve into the innovative techniques and applications that enable diverse autonomous agents and interconnected robots to learn, adapt, and collaboratively achieve complex objectives. The focus will be on leveraging CI paradigms such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary computation, and swarm intelligence to enhance communication, coordination, and collective decision-making within these sophisticated systems. Our aim is to foster advancements in designing robust, flexible, and intelligent multi-agent and robotic platforms capable of operating effectively in dynamic and challenging environments."
